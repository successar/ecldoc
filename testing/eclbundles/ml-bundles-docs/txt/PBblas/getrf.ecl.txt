FUNCTION : DATASET(Layout_Cell) getrf(DATASET(Layout_Cell) A)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LU Factorization Splits a matrix into Lower and Upper triangular 
factors Produces composite LU matrix for the diagonal blocks. Ite
rates through the matrix a row of blocks and column of blocks at 
a time. Partition A into M block rows and N block columns. The A1
1 cell is a single block. A12 is a single row of blocks with N-1 
columns. A21 is a single column of blocks with M-1 rows. A22 is a
 sub-matrix of M-1 x N-1 blocks. | A11 A12 | | L11 0 | | U11 U12 
| | A21 A22 | == | L21 L22 | * | 0 U22 | | L11*U11 L11*U12 | == |
 L21*U11 L21*U12 + L22*U22 | Based upon PB-BLAS: A set of paralle
l block basic linear algebra subprograms by Choi and Dongarra Thi
s module supports the "Myriad" style interface, allowing many ind
ependent problems to be worked on at once. The A matrix can conta
in multiple matrixes to be factored, indicated by different value
s for work-item id (wi_id). Note: The returned matrix includes bo
th the upper and lower factors. This matrix can be used directly 
by trsm which will only use the part indicated by trsm's 'triangl
e' parameter (i.e. upper or lower). To extract the upper or lower
 triangle explicitly for other purposes, use the ExtractTri funct
ion. When passing the Lower matrix to the triangle solver (trsm),
 set the "Diagonal" parameter to "UnitTri". This is necessary bec
ause both triangular matrixes returned from this function are pac
ked into a square matrix with only one diagonal. By convention, T
he Lower triangle is assumed to be a Unit Triangle (diagonal all 
ones), so the diagonal contained in the returned matrix is for th
e Upper factor and must be ignored (i.e. assumed to be all ones) 
when referencing the Lower triangle.
