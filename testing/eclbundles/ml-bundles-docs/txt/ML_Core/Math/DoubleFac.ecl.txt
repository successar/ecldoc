EMBED : REAL8 DoubleFac(INTEGER2 i)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 'double' factorial is defined for ODD n and is the product of all the
odd numbers up to and including that number. We are extending the meaning
to even numbers to mean the product of the even numbers up to and including
that number. Thus DoubleFac(8) = 8*6*4*2 We also defend against i < 2
(returning 1.0)

Parameter : i INTEGER2 --- the value used in the calculation

Return : REAL8 the factorial of the sequence, declining by
         2
