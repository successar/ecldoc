    <content>&#10;&#32;* The &apos;double&apos; factorial is defined for ODD n and is the product of
 * all the odd numbers up to and including that number.
 * We are extending the meaning to even numbers to mean the product
 * of the even numbers up to and including that number.
 * Thus DoubleFac(8) = 8*6*4*2
 * We also defend against i &lt; 2 (returning 1.0)
 *@param i the value used in the calculation
 *@return the factorial of the sequence, declining by 2&#10;&#32;</content>
