signature evaluation not working correctly if :

*. File have BOM
*. File contains \r char
*. Files with trailing whitespaces
*. Files with Unicode chars

Include Paths in eclcc are not working correctly for some tests
*. Related to https://github.com/hpcc-systems/HPCC-Platform/pull/10208
*. For example : If code contains IMPORT A.B; and IMPORT B; where A resides in some external directory.
*. Then we need to specify both <path to parent of A> and <path to A> in eclcc to work correctly.
